# Assignment 

### Generate Token
Since this was a timeboxed assignment I didn't get the chance to implement authentication using github API. So, please generate you own token using the following steps:
- Log into github and go the below link and generate your token.
https://github.com/settings/tokens 
- Go to `graphqlClient.ts` file in the project and paste your generated token there (path to file: `/src/utils/graphqlClient.ts`) and you are all set :).

### Steps to run the project
- Install dependencies using `npm install`.
- Start the project `npm start`.

### Steps to run the project
- Make sure all dependencies are installed, if not then run `npm install` to install them.
- Run all unit tests `npm test`.
- Run all unit tests with coverage `npm test -- --coverage`.
- Run a specific test unit test `npm test -- {your test name}`.
